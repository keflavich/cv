\section*{Areas of Research: }
\begin{itemize}
    \item The astrophysics of massive star formation and the processes
        governing the stellar initial mass function.
    \item The physical properties of the molecular interstellar medium,
        supersonic turbulence, and formaldehyde and other molecules as probes
        of local physical conditions. 
    \item Single-dish heterodyne and continuum millimeter observing, radio
        single-dish and synthesis array  imaging,  and optical and near
        infrared imaging and spectroscopy. 
    \item The development of software tools for the analysis and visualization
        of diffuse and extended emission, spectral data cubes, and large
        astronomical data sets.
