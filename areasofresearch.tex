\section*{Areas of Research: }
\begin{itemize}
    \item The astrophysics of massive star formation and the processes
        governing the stellar initial mass function.
    \item The physical properties of the molecular interstellar medium,
        supersonic turbulence, and developing molecular probes
        of local physical conditions.Â 
    \item Multiwavelength observing with radio interferometers and single dish
        instruments and near-infrared imaging and spectroscopy
    \item The development of astronomical software tools, especially for large
        data cubes and archival data access.
